//    Procedural Programming:
//    Focus: Procedural programming focuses on creating a step-by-step procedure or algorithm to solve a problem. It revolves around functions or procedures that manipulate data.
//    Data and Functions: In procedural programming, data and functions are treated separately. Data is stored in variables, and functions operate on this data.
//            Top-down Approach: Procedural programming typically follows a top-down approach, where the main program calls various functions to accomplish a task.
//    Example: Consider a program to calculate the area of a rectangle in procedural programming:



//    Focus: Object-oriented programming focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects that have data (attributes) and behavior (methods).
//    Objects: In OOP, objects are instances of classes. Classes define the structure and behavior of objects.
//    Encapsulation: OOP promotes encapsulation, where data and methods that operate on the data are bundled together within a class, providing data hiding and abstraction.
//            Example: Consider a program to model a rectangle using OOP principles:



//
//    Comparison:
//    Procedural programming focuses on procedures or functions that manipulate data, whereas OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects with data and behavior.
//    In procedural programming, data and functions are treated separately, while OOP promotes encapsulation by bundling data and methods together within classes.
//    Procedural programming follows a top-down approach, whereas OOP promotes a bottom-up approach, where objects collaborate to achieve a task.
